INFS2400 Web Development- Crime in Brazil

Red Team will independently investigate a social issue in Brazil and develop an informational website. The project scope is to help those that do not live in Brazil better understand a particular social issue. For social issues to tackle, I recommend starting with the following Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_issues_in_Brazil. In addition, the project should attempt to address one or more targets of the UN Sustainability Goals found at: https://sdgs.un.org/goals. You are encouraged to go beyond the obvious issues and focus on topics that interest you.
