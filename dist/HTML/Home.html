				<div class="fs-1">Brazil's Inequality Timeline</div>
				<p class="my-5">
					Over the past decade or so, Brazil—a still highly unequal country—has been the poster child for social mobility. According to the World Bank’s international poverty line, Brazil slashed
					poverty from 25 percent of the population in 2004 to 8.5 percent in 2014. Extreme poverty declined from 12 to 4 percent over the same period.2 As millions were lifted out of poverty, the
					middle class was boosted. The most commonly used inequality measure – the Gini coefficient (the closer to 1, the more unequal) – declined from 0.60 in 1990 to 0.51 in 2014 according to World
					Bank’s data. Inequality reduction was achieved thanks to a decade-long period of economic growth and deliberate income and social inclusion policies, such as minimum wage increases and
					targeted social programs. Yet, inequality remains high: based on data from the 2014 Pesquisa National de Amostra de Domicílios (PNAD), labor income of the population in the top decile of the
					income distribution corresponds to 40 percent of labor income of all Brazilian families, the top 1 per cent receives about 12 percent, and the top 0.1 per cent around 2.5 percent. Half
					percent of all labor income is concentrated in the top 0.01 percent.

														discussions of eugenics and the country's demographics hindering its development, the first Brazilian Republic decided to institute a policy of “whitening” wherein it would
														try to dilute the black population and drive out all signs of African culture. European immigrants would have intercourse with demographics along with suppression of
														African and Indigenous culture all in an effort to erase the presence of blacks from Brazil. This policy lasted until 1910 and because of it the percentage of whites in
														Brazil jumped from 34 percent in 1870 to 64 percent in 1940.
