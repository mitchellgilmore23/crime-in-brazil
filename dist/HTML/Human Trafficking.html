					<h3 id="whatIs">What is Human Trafficking?</h3>
					<p>
						Human trafficking is the trade of humans for the purpose of forced labor, sexual slavery, or commercial sexual exploitation. Human trafficking can occur within a country or
						trans-nationally. It is distinct from people smuggling, which is characterized by the consent of the person being smuggled.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 id="types">Types of Human Trafficking</h3>
					<h5>Sex Trafficking</h5>
					<p>
						Is human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation. It has been called a form of modern slavery because of the way victims are forced into sexual acts non-consensually, in a form
						of sexual slavery.
					</p>

					<h5>Labor Trafficking</h5>
					<p>Is a form of human trafficking where victims are made to perform a task through force, fraud, or coercion.</p>

					<h5>Children Trafficking</h5>
					<p>Is a form of human trafficking, that move children, typically for the purposes of forced labor of sexual exploitation.</p>

					<h5>Organ Trafficking</h5>
					<p>
						Is the recruitment, transport, transfer, harboring, or receipt of living or deceased persons or their organs by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of
						abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability, or of the giving to, or the receiving by, a third party of payments or benefits to achieve the
						transfer of control over the potential donor, for the purpose of exploitation by the removal of organs for transplantation.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 id="routes">Trafficking Routes</h3>
					<p>Child sex trafficking occurs along Brazil's highways, including BR-386, BR-116, and BR-285. Child sex tourists typically arrive from Europe, and to a lesser extent, the United States.</p>
					<p>
						Women and children are also trafficked from Brazil internationally for sexual exploitation in countries including Spain, Italy, Portugal, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, the
						United States, Switzerland, France, and Japan. Brazilian authorities have found evidence that foreign organized criminal networks, specifically from Russia and Spain, are involved in the
						sex trafficking of Brazilian women.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 id="states">Most Vulnerable States in Brazil</h3>
					<p>
						Traffickers often move forced laborers from poorer northeastern rural states of Brazil south into wealthier interior, metropolitan areas. The Brazilian states most impacted by
						international human trafficking include Goias, Minas Gerais, and Pernambuco, and the Brazilian cities most impacted by trafficking are Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Brazil's border states
						of Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraná, and Rio Grande do Sul are also all hubs for sex trafficking.

					</ul>

				<div>
					<h3 id="recruting">Tactics for Recruiting</h3>
					<p>
						Traffickers use a variety of unethical means to recruit people into modern slavery. People are often tricked into sex trafficking and forced labor through false promises of jobs and debt
						bondage. Middlemen known as “Gatos” promise vulnerable targets better employment, food, and housing. When they arrive, the victims find they have already accrued outrageous debts for food,
						housing, and the equipment needed to do their jobs. Employers are even known to hire armed guards to prevent modern slaves from escaping. In some cases, local authorities were aware of the
						exploitation and allowed it to continue.
					</p>
					<p>
						Traffickers often remove victims' identification documents once they arrive at their destination, so they cannot find other jobs or go back home. In some situations, traffickers guard
						their victims at night, lock them in their rooms, and threaten them with violence if they do not cooperate.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 id="laws">Laws About Human Trafficking</h3>
					<p>
						The government increased law enforcement efforts. Article 149a of the penal code criminalized some forms of sex trafficking and all forms of labor trafficking and prescribed penalties of
						four to eight years' imprisonment and a fine, which were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as
						rape. Inconsistent with international law, Article 149a required force, fraud, or coercion for child sex trafficking cases and therefore did not criminalize all forms of child sex
						trafficking. However, Article 244a of the child and adolescent statute criminalized inducing a child to engage in sexual exploitation without the need to prove the use of force, fraud, or
						coercion and prescribed penalties of four to 10 years' imprisonment and a fine, which were sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as
						rape. Additionally, Article 149 of the penal code prescribed penalties of two to eight years' imprisonment and a fine. It prohibited “slave labor,” or reducing a person to a condition
						analogous to slavery and defined forced labor to include degrading work conditions and exhausting work hours, going beyond situations in which people are held in service through force,
						fraud, or coercion.
