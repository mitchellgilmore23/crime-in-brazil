					<h3 id="whatIs">What is Human Trafficking?</h3>
					<p>
						Human trafficking is the trade of humans for the purpose of forced labor, sexual slavery, or commercial sexual exploitation. Human trafficking can occur within a country or trans-nationally. It is distinct from people smuggling, which is characterized by the consent of the person being smuggled.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 id="types">Types of Human Trafficking</h3>
					<h5>Sex Trafficking</h5>
					<p>
						Is human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation. 
						It has been called a form of modern slavery because of the way 
						victims are forced into sexual acts non-consensually, in a form 
						of sexual slavery.
					</p>

					<h5>Labor Trafficking </h5>
					<p>
						Is a form of human trafficking where victims are made to perform a
						task through force, fraud, or coercion.
					</p>

					<h5>Children Trafficking</h5>
					<p>
						Is a form of human trafficking, that move children, typically
						for the purposes of forced labor of sexual exploitation.
					</p>

					<h5>Organ Trafficking</h5>
					<p>
						Is the recruitment, transport, transfer, harboring, or receipt of 
						living or deceased persons or their organs by means of the threat
						or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, 
						of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability, 
						or of the giving to, or the receiving by, a third party of payments 
						or benefits to achieve the transfer of control over the potential 
						donor, for the purpose of exploitation by the removal of organs for 
						transplantation.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 id="routes">Trafficking Routes</h3>
					<p>
						Child sex trafficking occurs along Brazil's highways, including 
						BR-386, BR-116, and BR-285. Child sex tourists typically arrive 
						from Europe, and to a lesser extent, the United States. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Women and children are also trafficked from Brazil internationally 
						for sexual exploitation in countries including Spain, Italy, 
						Portugal, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, the United 
						States, Switzerland, France, and Japan. Brazilian authorities have 
						found evidence that foreign organized criminal networks, specifically 
						from Russia and Spain, are involved in the sex trafficking of Brazilian 
						women.
					</p>

				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 id="states">Most Vulnerable States in Brazil</h3>
					<p>Traffickers often move forced laborers from poorer northeastern rural 
						states of Brazil south into wealthier interior,	metropolitan areas. 
						The Brazilian states most impacted by international human trafficking 
						include Goias, Minas Gerais, and Pernambuco, and the Brazilian cities 
						most impacted by trafficking are Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Brazil's 
						border states of Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraná, and Rio Grande do Sul are 
						also all hubs for sex trafficking.
					</p>

				<div>
					<h3 id="recruting">Tactics for Recruiting</h3>
					<p>
						Traffickers use a variety of unethical means to recruit people into 
						modern slavery. People are often tricked into sex trafficking and 
						forced labor through false promises of jobs and debt bondage. 
						Middlemen known as “Gatos” promise vulnerable targets better 
						employment, food, and housing. When they arrive, the victims find they 
						have already accrued outrageous debts for food, housing, and the 
						equipment needed to do their jobs. Employers are even known to hire 
						armed guards to prevent modern slaves from escaping. In some cases,
						local authorities were aware of the exploitation and allowed it to 
						continue.
					</p>
					<p>
						Traffickers often remove victims' identification documents once they 
						arrive at their destination, so they cannot find other jobs or go back 
						home. In some situations, traffickers guard their victims at night, 
						lock them in their rooms, and threaten them with violence if they do 
						not cooperate.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 id="laws">Laws About Human Trafficking</h3>
					<p>The
						government increased law enforcement efforts. Article 149a of the penal code
						criminalized some forms of sex trafficking and all forms of labor trafficking
						and prescribed penalties of four to eight years' imprisonment and a fine, which
						were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate
						with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Inconsistent with
						international law, Article 149a required
						force, fraud, or coercion for child sex trafficking cases and therefore did not
						criminalize all forms of child sex trafficking. However, Article 244a of the
						child and adolescent statute criminalized inducing a child to engage in sexual
						exploitation without the need to prove the use of force, fraud, or coercion and
						prescribed penalties of four to 10 years' imprisonment and a fine, which were
						sufficiently stringent and commensurate
						with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Additionally,
						Article 149 of the penal code prescribed penalties of two to eight years'
						imprisonment and a fine. It prohibited “slave labor,” or reducing a person to a
						condition analogous to slavery and
						defined
						forced labor to include degrading work conditions and
						exhausting
						work hours, going beyond situations in which people are held in service through
						force, fraud, or coercion.</p>
