			<h2><strong>Problem</strong></h2>
			<p>
				Income inequality and poverty mainly presumes the faces of black and brown people in Brazil. These groups are more likely to be in the bottom half of the wealth distribution: 75% of Black
				families and 67% of Hispanic families, compared to 41% of white families.
			</p>
			<p>
				Two thirds of all the poor are black, 70% of the total population living in poverty (38 million people) are city dwellers and 51% (27 million) live in the northeast region. This contrast
				between a small rich country and a huge poor country was referred to by the Brazilian economist Edmar Bacha in the 1970s as the ‘Belindia’ model: an unfortunate mixture of Indian poverty and
				Belgian affluence.
			</p>
			<p>
				While income inequality in Brazil has continued to decrease since the early 2000s, in comparison with many Latin American country’s, Brazil’s income is significantly unequal. In fact, during
				this same period income inequality has increased, having a coefficient inequality of disposable income in Brazil in 2013 that was 0.47, almost 50% higher than the Oragnisation for Economic
				Co-operation and Development (OECD) average (0.315). Nonetheless, when compared to international standards, the income inequality is still very high as seen in the chart below.

			<p>
				Factors contributing to this income disparity include the rural urban divide, low levels of education, taxation, and high land ownership concentration. The distribution of wealth in Brazil
				accounts for a massive part of the country’s problem with income and net worth inequality. The top 10% of the population in the financial ranks contributes to nearly 40% of the national
				income; while the bottom 10% contributes to merely 1% of the National Income.

			<h2 class="my-3"><strong>Solution</strong></h2>

			<p>Further progress in reducing inequality requires a policy package built on three pillars:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>promoting inclusive employment</li>
				<li>improving the redistributive effectiveness of the tax</li>
				<li>benefit system and investing more into education and skills</li>
			</ul>

			<h3><strong>Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities</strong></h3>

			<p>
				The United Nations Sustainable Developmetn Goals is an urge for coutnries to particiapte in the call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure the peace and prosperity of all
				people.
			</p>

			<p>
				While there are many goals and problems to addressing the challenges, countries like Brazil are facing. It is important to not prioritize any specific area and instead target these challenges
				simultaneously.
			</p>
			<p>In doing so, Brazil is more likely to achieve goals towards combating economic disparity.</p>
			<p>Goal 10 is to "reduce uncome inequality iwthing and among countries" This goal has ten targets whose progress is measured by indicators to determine whether they are achevied by 2030.</p>
			<p>Outcome Targets:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Reduce income inequalities</li>
				<li>Promote universal social</li>
				<li>Economic and political inclusion</li>
				<li>Ensure equal opportunities and end discrimination</li>
				<li>Adopt fiscal and social policies that promotes equality</li>
				<li>Improved regulation of global financial markets and institutions</li>
				<li>Enhanced representation for developing countries in financial institutions; responsible and well-managed migration policies</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Implementation Targets:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Special and differential treatment for developing countries</li>
				<li>Encourage development assistance and investment in least developed countries</li>
				<li>Reduce transaction costs for migrant remittances</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				In addressing this goal to combat Brazil's income inequality, equal opportunity would be readily available to all citizens despite their household income. Targeting this goal could end
				discrimanation progressively and create more opportunity for the implementation of developmental assisstnace programs with a focus to build businesses, create jobs, and open doors for future
				investments.
